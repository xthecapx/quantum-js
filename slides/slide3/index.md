    <ul>
        <li>Can be both waves and particles. <span class="cursor-pointer" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Quantum objects exhibit wave-particle duality, meaning they can behave like waves or particles depending on the experiment.">⚠️</span></li>
        <li>Can be in multiple states at <strong>once</strong>, but it's impossible to know two properties at <strong>once</strong>. <span class="cursor-pointer" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Measuring one property of a quantum system disturbs it, making it impossible to know two properties with certainty at the same time.">⚠️</span></li>
        <li>Interact <strong>instantaneously</strong> regardless of <strong>distance</strong>. <span class="cursor-pointer" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Quantum entanglement allows two or more particles to be connected in such a way that measuring the state of one particle instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.">⚠️</span></li>
