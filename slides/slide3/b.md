### Lets talk about Quantum

Quantum mechanics confuses people because:

* A quantum object can be both a wave and a particle (‚ùå wave-particle duality).

It's possible for quantum objects to be in multiple states at the same time. (Superposition)

It's impossible to know two properties of a quantum object simultaneously.

There is instantaneous interaction between quantum objects, regardless of distance. (Entanglement)

An observer cannot be excluded from the theory since nothing can be measured without altering it.

Everything that can happen does.
